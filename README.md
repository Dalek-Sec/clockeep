Minimal utility to track time usage and productivity

I slapped this together to help me know how I spend my time by making it very convenient for me to track my time usage.
This project is early WIP, but I find it usable for myself is it is.

## Usage
:a<group name> - add group
 
:<group number> - toggle whether group is punched in
 
:n<group number> - add a note under group
 
:r<group number> [weeks back] - print a report for the current week or for however many weeks back are specified

Planned features:
 - Supergroups for easily getting reports of several groups combined
 - Something I forgot
 - Scheduled report emails
